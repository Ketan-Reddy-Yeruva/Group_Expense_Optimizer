## 📌 Project Overview
<!--Cash Flow Minimizer--> 
Group Expense Optimizer is a system designed to **reduce the number of monetary transactions** required to settle debts among a group of individuals or entities who have borrowed money from one another.

Instead of multiple back-and-forth payments, this project computes an **optimized settlement plan** using graph-based optimization techniques such as **Greedy Algorithms** and **Min-Cost Max-Flow**.

### Why this project?
- Minimizes total number of transactions  
- Reduces operational and transaction costs  
- Demonstrates real-world application of DSA concepts

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Given a set of people and the money they owe each other, determine the **minimum number of transactions** required to settle all debts such that everyone’s final balance becomes zero.
